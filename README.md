# Sanchez-et-al.-2017-Nature-Communications
Workflows
# These were the workflows for solving several bioinformatic analysis for Sanchez et al. (2017) Nat Comm.
# I used standard open-source software in Linux command-line, and custom-made python scripts (I kept here the original names of the python script's files to match my records)
# It also involved some manual organization of files, manual assessment of results and manual processing to reach final result (e.g.sequence reconstruction).
# Although it solved the problems faced at the time, note that this is a beginner's code, as I'm not a professional bioinformatician or data scientist.
# As such, it may probably look overly complicated; and other more advanced solutions are likely simpler or more effective.
# The workflow also display some historical contingencies, as I was learning while doing.
# None of this work would be possible without the collaboration with Herve Gaubert, and the kind bioinformatics support of Varodom Charoensawan, Hugo Tavares, Jeremy Gruel, Hajk-Georg Drost, Anna Gogleva and Yassin Refahi.
